          Atlas Café, a beloved fixture in Courtenay, BC, has been serving the
          community since 1995. Founded by Trent McIntyre and Sandra Viney, the

          fresh, scratch-made cuisine. Its name, "Atlas," reflects the
          international flavors and experiences that shaped its creation.

              Had an amazing meal with the fam last night. So many options and
              all of ours were great. Perfect service and the room is so
              comfortable. No wonder they have been around as long as they have.

              Atlas Cafe was able to provide my companions and I delicious food
              and good service within a tight time frame. I appreciated the
              responsiveness of their friendly staff and the simpleness of the
              menu.

              Omg, I thought I died and went to heaven! The Angela burger, with
              the blue cheese and poached pears, and add-on caramelized
              onions... Can't stop talking about it. Going to bring my foodie
              son to try it! Thank you for a sensational experience for my taste
              buds!!

              Really glad we stopped in here on a recent trip to the Comox
              valley! Delicious dinner, drinks and excellent service. Thank you
              to the bartender who even wrote us a list of recommendations for
              places to visit on our trip!
