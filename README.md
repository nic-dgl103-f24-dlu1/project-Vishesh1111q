# Project Website Plan

## 1. Project Summary

**Chosen Website:**  
[Atlas Cafe](https://www.atlascafe.ca/)

**Why the Client Needs a New Website:**  
The current website for Atlas Cafe is outdated in terms of design, responsiveness, and accessibility. It lacks a modern aesthetic and does not provide a seamless user experience, especially on mobile devices.

**Important Purpose of the Website:**  
The primary goal is to attract more customers by showcasing the cafe’s menu, atmosphere, and community presence. It should also provide essential information such as location, hours, and upcoming events to engage visitors and encourage them to visit in person.

**Target Audience:**
- Local customers looking for a cozy cafe experience.  
- Tourists visiting the area seeking unique dining options.  
- Regular customers interested in updates on specials or events.

**Overall Message and Actions:**  
The website should convey Atlas Cafe as a welcoming, vibrant, and community-focused spot. Visitors should feel compelled to:  
- Browse the menu.  
- Check out the cafe's ambiance through images or videos.  
- Visit the cafe or place an order.

**Current Site Issues:**  
- **Accessibility:** Limited adherence to accessibility standards (e.g., poor contrast, lack of alt text).  
- **Speed:** Suboptimal performance and loading times.  
- **Design:** Outdated visuals and layout, making navigation difficult.  
- **Responsiveness:** The site doesn’t adapt well to different screen sizes.
